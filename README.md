# weather-_visualization
Simple visualization of weather dataset using python libraries (such as seaborn, pandas, etc..)

*Take a glance of what the functions are really mean before starting your plot*

Following are some of the functions used to represent the dataset:

1. displot - Used to visualize **continous dataset**. Only one column can be executed at a time.
2. jointplot(bivariate function) - Helps to visualize 2 column data in a single plot.
3. stripplot - It is used to visualize the distribution of categorical data.It uses scatter plot.
               // if your data on plot is too messy you can use the command --> **jitter = True**
4. boxplot - It is useful for colorful representation of 2 columns at a time.
5. countplot - It is used in case of visualizing the **discrete dataset**.
